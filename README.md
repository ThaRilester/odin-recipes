<h1> First Project Odin-Recipes </h1>
<p> This is the firsr project I am working towards completion using the Odin Project curriculum. So far I've actually been able to succsesfully work my way into git bash/hub and send different commits over into my online github. Obviously I'm not doing anything to big but I am amazed at how I've been able to relatively learn this system so far and that is self-impressive. </p>
