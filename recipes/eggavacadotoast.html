<h2>A wonderfull and healthy snack</h2>
<p>Our avocado and egg toast starts with golden, crispy bread layered with creamy smashed avocado and topped with a perfectly poached egg.
     The rich yolk blends into the avocado for a smooth, flavorful bite, while the toast adds the perfect crunch. It’s a fresh, protein-packed option that feels light yet indulgent — ideal for breakfast, brunch, or a quick, healthy bite any time of day.</p>
